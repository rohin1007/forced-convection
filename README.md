# Forced Convection over a Flat Plate

Numerical modelling of forced convection over a flat was carried out using ANSYS Fluent Solver. A fluid at freestream temperature 353K and pressure of 101325Pa is flowing over a flat plate at 413K. The Reynolds number based on the length of the plate is 1.5e06 and the Prandtl number is 0.71.

Wall y+ values are less than 1.5 except for anomalous values near the inlet. This means the boundary layer is well resolved. The U velocity profile at the outlet shows a fully developed flow. The U velocity increases from zero at the wall to 1m/s(freestream velocity) close to y=0.02m. Re vs Nu was plotted with the numerical results and compared to Seban & Doughty (1956). The results match with minimal errors.
